About ABM Industries:

ABM provides smart facility services across:
- Building maintenance
- HVAC, lighting, and electrical systems
- Janitorial and sanitation services
- Landscaping, parking, energy & sustainability
- Smart automation for commercial buildings

Strategic priorities:
- Robotics that assist in facility operations
- Smart building systems, IoT sensors, AI dashboards
- Sustainable automation and energy savings
- Commercial-ready tech, not research prototypes

  "Listings": [
    {
      "Company": "Company name",
      "Company Info": "1–2 line what the company does + industry served",
      "Region": "Country/region",
      "Focus": "2–5 word robotics focus",
      "Company Size": "Small / Medium / Large",
      "Raised Funding": "e.g. $80M or 'Not Disclosed'",
      "Recent Developments": "Key updates in last 12 months",
      "Partnerships": "If any, else 'None'",
      "Media Mentions": "Estimated mentions (e.g., 5, 10)",
      "Humanoid Robotics Use Case": "Yes/No + 1–2 lines",
      "Single Use Cases": "Yes/No + rationale",
      "Task Streamlining": "E.g. floor cleaning, inventory tracking",
      "Project Launch Date": "Only if explicitly stated; otherwise 'TBD'",
      "Relevancy Score": "1–5",
      "Correlation Reason": "Use A–D format to explain relevance or irrelevance to ABM. You must include all four labels (A, B, C, D) as separate sentences, even if some are marked 'Not Applicable'.",

 Correlation Reason (Must follow A–D):
A. Does it overlap with ABM’s services (e.g., HVAC, janitorial, parking)?  
B. Does it align with ABM’s smart facilities strategy (e.g., sensors, AI dashboards)?  
C. Does it offer unique robotics innovation?  
D. Is it commercially ready?

Even if a company is **not relevant**, still assign a score and explain **why not**.

 Rules:
- Always extract *all* robotics companies from the article
- Return **all 18 fields** listed above for each company — even if values are missing
- If data is missing, write: "TBD", "None", or "Not Disclosed"
- Output must be valid JSON. No markdown, no commentary, no preambles

USER_MESSAGE = f"Extract the following information from the provided text:\nPage content:\n\n"

PROMPT_PAGINATION = """
You are an assistant that extracts pagination URLs from markdown content of websites. 
Your task is to identify and generate a list of pagination URLs based on a detected URL pattern where page numbers increment sequentially. Follow these instructions carefully:

-Identify the Pagination Pattern:
Analyze the provided markdown text to detect URLs that follow a pattern where only a numeric page indicator changes.
If the numbers start from a low value and increment, generate the full sequence of URLs—even if not all numbers are present in the text.

-Construct Complete URLs:
In cases where only part of a URL is provided, combine it with the given base URL (which will appear at the end of this prompt) to form complete URLs.
Ensure that every URL you generate is clickable and leads directly to the intended page.

-Incorporate User Indications:
If additional user instructions about the pagination mechanism are provided at the end of the prompt, use those instructions to refine your URL generation.
Output Format Requirements:

-Strictly output only a valid JSON object with the exact structure below:
""
{
    "page_urls": ["url1", "url2", "url3", ..., "urlN"]
}""

IMPORTANT:

Output only a single valid JSON object with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanation.
Do not include any extra newlines or spaces before or after the JSON.
The JSON object must exactly match the following schema:
"""

PRIORITY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI assistant reading robotics news articles. Extract structured insights and assess business relevance.

Focus most on:
1. Single Use Case Robotics (e.g. vacuums, floor scrubbers, inspection robots)
2. Humanoid Robotics
3. Media Mentions across sources (Low / Medium / High)

Return this in JSON:

  "Company Name": "",
  "Type of Robot": "",
  "Is it a Single Use Case Robot?": "Yes/No + category (e.g. floor scrubber)",
  "Is it a Humanoid Robot?": "Yes/No",

  "Commercial Availability": "Yes/No + date if known",
  "Media Mentions": "Low/Medium/High",
  "Priority Score (1-3)": "1 if single use case, 2 if humanoid, 3 if media mentions only",
  "Summary": "One-line business summary of what this robot does"
